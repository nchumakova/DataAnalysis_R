## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## 1. Vectors
Assign a vector of 11 elements (1, 0.3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 9, 9.7) to the variable `test_a`.  
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.1  
test_a <- (1, 0.3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 9, 9.7)
Add 2 to each element of the vector test_a and assign the result to the variable `test_b`. Please provide your code here:  

### 1.2   
test_b <- test_a + 2
Calculate the difference between `test_a` and `test_b`. Please provide your code here:  

### 1.3  
test_a - test_b
Select the 3rd element of the vector `test_a`.  
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.4  
test_a[3]
Select the 3rd, 4th and 5th elements of the vector `test_a` and assign the result to the vector `test_c`.
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.5  ]
test_c <- test_a[c(3,4,5)
Print `test_c`.
test_c

Please provide your code here:  

### 1.6   

## Factors

Create the vector `test_d` with the elements "apple", "lemon", "orange".
test_d <- c("apple", "lemon", "orange")
### 2.1   

Convert them as factors to the variable `test_e`.  
test_e <- factor(test_d)
### 2.2
